## Overview

📌 In `joyn`, there are two major sets of tools to join data tables:

1.  The primary function `joyn()`

2.  Dplyr-like join functions: `left_join()`, `right_join()`, `full_join()`, `inner_join()`

This vignette will explore the main function `joyn()`. You can read about dplyr-joins in the [insert link of dplyr-joins vignette ?] article instead.

## General use

```{r dt}

library(joyn)
library(data.table)

x1 <- data.table(id = c(1L, 1L, 2L, 3L, NA_integer_),
                 t  = c(1L, 2L, 1L, 2L, NA_integer_),
                 x  = 11:15)

y1 <- data.table(id = c(1,2, 4),
                 y  = c(11L, 15L, 16))


x2 <- data.table(id = c(1, 4, 2, 3, NA),
                 t  = c(1L, 2L, 1L, 2L, NA_integer_),
                 x  = c(16, 12, NA, NA, 15))


y2 <- data.table(id = c(1, 2, 5, 6, 3),
                 yd = c(1, 2, 5, 6, 3),
                 y  = c(11L, 15L, 20L, 13L, 10L),
                 x  = c(16:20))

x3 <- data.table(id  = c("c","b", "d", "d"),
                 v   = 8:11,
                 foo = c(4,2, 7, 3))

y3 <- data.table(id = c("c","b", "c", "a"),
                 y  = c(11L, 15L, 18L, 20L))


x4 <- data.table(id1 = c(1, 1, 2, 3, 3),
                 id2 = c(1, 1, 2, 3, 4),
                 t   = c(1L, 2L, 1L, 2L, NA_integer_),
                 x   = c(16, 12, NA, NA, 15))

y4 <- data.table(id  = c(1, 2, 5, 6, 3),
                 id2 = c(1, 1, 2, 3, 4),
                 y   = c(11L, 15L, 20L, 13L, 10L),
                 x   = c(16:20))


x5 <- data.table(id      = c(1, 4, 2, 3, NA),
                 t       = c(1L, 2L, 1L, 2L, NA),
                 country = c(16, 12, 3, NA, 15))
  
y5 <- data.table(id      = c(1, 2, 2, 6, 3),
                 gdp     = c(11L, 15L, 20L, 13L, 10L),
                 country = 16:20)

```

### The basics

Let's suppose that you want to join the two tables `x1` and `y1`.

```{r simple-join}

# Calling joyn() to join x1 and y1

joyn(x = x1,
     y = y1, 
     match_type = "m:1" ) #Note RT: remove this argument once fixing the default value

```

The output table is the result of a *full join* -which is what `joyn` always executes by the default. This means that the returning table will retains both matching and non matching rows from both `x1` and `y1`. Notice that the resulting table also contains an additional variable called `.joyn`, which is the *reporting variable*. (Read below ⬇️)

#### Reporting variable

A particular feature of `joyn` is that it includes the **`reportvar`** in the returning table, which informs you about the status of the join. You can modify both the name and the format of the reporting variable as follows:

-   Name: by default `reportvar = ".joyn"`, but you can modify it with `reportvar = "myname"` specifiying the name you want to assign

-   Format: by default `reporttype = "character"` , but you can also set it to numeric using `reporttype = "numeric"`

You can see the difference between the two types in the table below[^1]:

[^1]: for a better understandingof the *meaning* column check the [update .TODO.] sections

TODO: CHOOSE ONE OF THE TWO TABLES

```{r echo =FALSE}

knitr::kable(
  tibble::tribble(
~numeric, ~character, ~meaning,
1, "x", "Obs only available in x table",
2, "y", "Obs only available in y table",
3, "x & y", "Matching obs available in both tables",
4, "NA updated", "NAs in x updated with actual values in variables with same names in y",
5, "value updated", "Actual values and NAs in x updated with actual values in variables with same names in y",
6, "not updated", "Actual values and NAs in x are NOT updated with actual values in y"
), format = "simple", align = "lcl")

```

```{r echo =FALSE}

df_reportvar <- data.frame(
  numeric   = c(1:6),
  character = c("x", "y", "x & y", "NA updated", "value updated", "not updated"),
  meaning   = c("Obs only available in x table", "Obs only available in y table", "Matching obs available in both tables", "NAs in x updated with actual values in variables with same names in y", "Actual values and NAs in x updated with actual values in variables with same names in y", "Actual values and NAs in x are NOT updated with actual values in y")
)

reactable::reactable(df_reportvar, highlight = TRUE, striped = TRUE, theme = cerulean())

```

#### Key variables (memo: add sort)

When performing a join, you might want to specify which variable(s) `joyn` should join by.

While by default `joyn` will consider the variable(s) in common between `x` and `y` as key(s) for the join, our suggestion is to make the keys explicit - i.e., specifying it/them in the `by` argument

```{r by-vars}

# Join with one variable in common

joyn(x = x1,
     y = y1, 
     by = "id", 
     match_type = "m:1")

```

If you don't want to join by all variables in common between `x` and `y`, you can alternately use equivalency as an element of `by` vector. This specification allows you to join on different variables between `x` and `y.`

```{r diff-by-vars}

joyn(x = x4, 
     y = y4, 
     by = c("id1 = id", "id2"), 
     match_type = "m:m")

```

Also, notice that `joyn` will `sort` the resulting table by key variables in `by`. This is because `sort = TRUE` by default.

### Match type

💡Match type refers to the relationship that exists between the observations of the joining tables. The possibility to perform joins based on the match type is one of the value added of using `joyn`.

Following Stata's convention, we can have four different match types:

1.  **1:1** (one to one): the ***default***[^2], the variables specified in `by` variables uniquely identify single observations in both table –\> each observation in left table has a unique match in the right table and viceversa

2.  **1:m** (one to many): only left table is uniquely identified by `by`variables –\> each observation in `by` var of the left table can have multiple matches in `by` var of the right table

3.  **m:1** (many to one): only right table is uniquely identified by `by`var -\> each observation in left table can have only one match in the right table but observations in the right table might have multiple matches in the left table

4.  **m:m** (many to many): variables in `by` does not uniquely identify the observations in either table –\> both tables can have multiple matches for each observation

[^2]: Notice that in the previous version default match type was "m:m" instead.

We recommend you always specify the match type when joining tables to ensure the output is correct.

```{r relationships}

# Many to one match type
joyn(x = x1,
     y = y1,
     by = "id",
     match_type = "m:1")

# Many to many match type
joyn(x = x3,
     y = y3,
     by = "id",
     match_type = "m:m")

# One to one match type - the default
joyn(x = x2,
     y = y2,
     by = "id",
     match_type = "1:1")

# Same join as:

joyn(x = x2,
     y = y2,
     by = "id")


# One to many match type 
joyn(x = x5,
     y = y5,
     by = "id",
     match_type = "1:m")

```

However, if are unsure/wrong about the relationships between the observations in your tables, `joyn` will let you know that something is not right. Suppose you think your data is uniquely identified by variable `id`, while it is not. By setting `match_type = "1:1"` you will get and error, informing you that the match type is not as expected.

```{r join-type, error=TRUE}

# Merging correctly but getting error because something is not right in the data
joyn(x3, y3, by = "id", match_type = "1:1")

# Merging wrongly but getting NO errors because you did not use match_type
joyn(x3, y3, by = "id")

```

If instead you don't care about match types or you don't think it is necessary to use them for your particular needs, you might be fine without `joyn`.

### Type of join

Join type determines which observations will be kept after the join. `joyn()` allows you to choose which type of join to execute via the `keep` argument.

This argument is called `keep` rather than `join_type` to avoid confusion with the argument `match_type`, and in order to reflect that what you are specifying in the end is which observations you want to keep. This argument plays the role of allowing `joyn()` to mimic the behavior of `dplyr`'s functions `left_join`, `right_join`, `inner_join`, and `full_join`, the default.

`keep` can be of four types:

-   **`keep = "full"`**: the default, which keeps *all* the observations in x and y, regardless of whether they match or not.

    ```{r full}

    # Full join 

    joyn(x          = x1, 
         y          = y1, 
         match_type = "m:m")

    ```

-   **`keep = "left"`** or **`keep = "master"`** : keeps all observations in `x`, both matching and non, and only those observations in `y` that match in `x`

    ```{r left}

    # keep obs in x

    joyn(x          = x1, 
         y          = y1, 
         keep       = "left", 
         match_type = "m:m")

    ```

-   **`keep = "right"`** or **`keep = "using"`** keeps all observations in `y`, both matching and non, and only those observations in `x` that match in `y`

    ```{r right}

    # keep obs in y

    joyn(x          = x1, 
         y          = y1,
         keep       = "right", 
         match_type = "m:m")

    ```

-   **`keep = "inner"`** keeps only those observations that match in *both* tables.

    ```{r inner}

    # keep matching obs in both tables

    joyn(x1, y1, keep = "inner", match_type = "m:m")

    ```
